        Economics experiments have a strict policy against deception. If we do anything deceptive, or donâ€™t pay you as
        described, then you can complain to the campus Human Subjects Committee and we will be in serious trouble.
        These instructions are meant to clarify how the experiment truly works and how you can earn the most money in
        this experiment.
        Our primary interest is to observe the decisions of people who have been given an accurate understanding of the
        experiment and how their decisions will influence their outcomes and earnings.
